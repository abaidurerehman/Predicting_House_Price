# Predicting House Prices using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and other factors. The model is built using machine learning algorithms and deployed using Flask with a React-based frontend.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Flask Backend**: Handles API requests for predictions.
- **React Frontend**: Provides an interactive UI for users to enter property details and get price predictions.
- **Database Integration**: Stores user data and prediction history (MongoDB/MySQL).
- **Jupyter Notebook Support**: Enables easy experimentation and visualization.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js & npm
- Git
- Anaconda (Optional for Jupyter Notebook)

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/abaidurerehman/Predicting_House_Price.git
cd Predicting_House_Price
